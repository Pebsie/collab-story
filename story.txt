Once there was a little piggy that went to market ...,
Once there was somebody told me, the world was going to roll me. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. 
According to all known laws
of aviation, once there was a Large dude called kevin... a
frog, who sat happily upon a log. 
He counted to ten, then started again,
Because he was programmed in Prolog.
Once there was a bee called Tom,
who wanted a tree
sadly, they were a twat
but sometimes it just be like that
Once there was a man called fred,
He had a very big head,
he didnt like bread,
and now he is dead
Once there was a unicorn called Ben.
He loved to show off his horn.
Once there was a penny. Her name was susan
 bloke who when to a Git workshop, 'cause he was bad at Computer Science.
Once there was a
 cat called Marmalade,
That belonged to a man named Kevin,
It was an orange moggy,
Associated with visions of heaven.

Imagine a cat on one shoulder,
Jar of marmalade on the other,
It's bound to make you tingle,
Something you want to smother

When you see this man called Kevin,
Naked inside your head,
You'll drown yourself in love,
For a preserve to leave you dead.
